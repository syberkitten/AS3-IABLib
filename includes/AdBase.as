/**
 * Companion banners are ads that display outside
 * the video player area to reinforce the
 * messaging provided in the video ad unit. In
 * some cases, a VPAID ad unit may request ads
 * from other ad servers after initAd() has been
 * called, and makes a decision about which ad it
 * will display, which may or may not include ad
 * companions. For example, a client-side yield
 * management SDK may wrap itself in a VPAID ad
 * when a native SDK integration might be cumbersome.
 * In this scenario, the ad server that served the
 * initial VAST response may not know which ad will
 * be displayed, and therefore the VAST response
 * itself does not include ad companions.
 *
 * <p>VPAID 2.0 enables an ad server to serve a
 * VAST response which has no companions, but which
 * does have a VPAID ad unit that pulls in ad
 * companions dynamically based on the adserving
 * situation. The video player can then check the
 * VPAID ad unit for ad companions when the VAST
 * response has none.</p>
 *
 * <p>The video player is not required to poll this
 * property, and because ad companion information
 * from the VAST response takes precedence over
 * VPAID ad companions, the video player should only
 * access this property when the VAST response is
 * absent of any ad companions.</p>
 *
 * <p>The value of this property is a String that
 * provides ad companion details in VAST 3.0 format
 * for the &lt;CompanionAds&gt; element, and should
 * contain all the media files and details for
 * displaying the ad companions (i.e. the format
 * should be of an InLine response and not in
 * Wrapper format). Also, the value should only
 * include details within the &lt;CompanionAds&gt;
 * element and not an entire VAST response. If any XML
 * elements are included outside of the
 * &lt;CompanionAds&gt; element, they must be ignored,
 * including any &lt;Impression&gt; elements that might
 * have been included. However, VAST companion ad
 * &lt;TrackingEvents&gt; elements for
 * &lt;Tracking event="creativeView"&gt; must be respected.</p>
 *
 * <p>If the video player calls for adCompanions(),
 * it must wait until after receiving the VPAID
 * AdLoaded event, and any companions provided must
 * not display until after the VPAID AdImpression
 * event is received. Delaying companion display
 * until after the AdImpression event prevents display
 * of any companion banners in the case where the
 * video ad fails to register an impression.If this
 * property is used but no Companions are available
