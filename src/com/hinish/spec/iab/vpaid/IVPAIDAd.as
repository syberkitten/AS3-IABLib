		 * Companion banners are ads that display outside
		 * the video player area to reinforce the
		 * messaging provided in the video ad unit. In
		 * some cases, a VPAID ad unit may request ads
		 * from other ad servers after initAd() has been
		 * called, and makes a decision about which ad it
		 * will display, which may or may not include ad
		 * companions. For example, a client-side yield
		 * management SDK may wrap itself in a VPAID ad
		 * when a native SDK integration might be cumbersome.
		 * In this scenario, the ad server that served the
		 * initial VAST response may not know which ad will
		 * be displayed, and therefore the VAST response
		 * itself does not include ad companions.
		 *
		 * <p>VPAID 2.0 enables an ad server to serve a
		 * VAST response which has no companions, but which
		 * does have a VPAID ad unit that pulls in ad
		 * companions dynamically based on the adserving
		 * situation. The video player can then check the
		 * VPAID ad unit for ad companions when the VAST
		 * response has none.</p>
		 *
		 * <p>The video player is not required to poll this
		 * property, and because ad companion information
		 * from the VAST response takes precedence over
		 * VPAID ad companions, the video player should only
		 * access this property when the VAST response is
		 * absent of any ad companions.</p>
		 *
		 * <p>The value of this property is a String that
		 * provides ad companion details in VAST 3.0 format
		 * for the &lt;CompanionAds&gt; element, and should
		 * contain all the media files and details for
		 * displaying the ad companions (i.e. the format
		 * should be of an InLine response and not in
		 * Wrapper format). Also, the value should only
		 * include details within the &lt;CompanionAds&gt;
		 * element and not an entire VAST response. If any XML
		 * elements are included outside of the
		 * &lt;CompanionAds&gt; element, they must be ignored,
		 * including any &lt;Impression&gt; elements that might
		 * have been included. However, VAST companion ad
		 * &lt;TrackingEvents&gt; elements for
		 * &lt;Tracking event="creativeView"&gt; must be respected.</p>
		 *
		 * <p>If the video player calls for adCompanions(),
		 * it must wait until after receiving the VPAID
		 * AdLoaded event, and any companions provided must
		 * not display until after the VPAID AdImpression
		 * event is received. Delaying companion display
		 * until after the AdImpression event prevents display
		 * of any companion banners in the case where the
		 * video ad fails to register an impression.If this
		 * property is used but no Companions are available
		 * the property should return an empty string.</p>
